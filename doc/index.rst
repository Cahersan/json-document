JSON Document
=============

This package provides intuitive and powerful binding system for JSON documents.
It bridged the gap between raw python objects, json schema and json files.  A
powerful default system also allows developers to access an empty document and
see the default values from the schema without any code changes.

Installation
------------

You can install ``json-document`` from source using pip. Please note that currently
the code is in **alpha** stages and is not recommended outside of the early
adopter group.
